  "faqs": {
    "question-1": "HOW MUCH SHOULD I EXPECT TO PAY FOR A WEBSITE?",
    "answer-1": "Everything depends on the scope of the project. During our first meeting, we will seek to define the needs and key points of your project: the number of pages, specific functionalities, urgency, and the quantity of necessary animations are determining factors that influence the final cost. The cost may increase significantly depending on the inherent complexity of its implementation. My goal is always to find a fair rate that suits both parties..",
    "question-2": "HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR MY SITE TO BE DISPLAYED?",
    "answer-2": "This will depend on your needs: <br/><br/> - A single landing-page may take between three and four weeks. <br/><br/> - A complete website with 5-10 pages may take between 6-8 weeks. <br/><br/> Of course, these figures are for information purposes only. If you already have all of your content beforehand and you don't have a lot of feedback, then the delivery time will be drastically reduced!",
